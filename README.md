# investment-adjuster
This is a very simple program that takes as input a Fidelity CSV file describing
an investment portfolio. It compares the holdings in the portfolio to a target
allocation configuration defined in a yaml file. It calculates the changes
necessary to bring the portfolio into alignment with the target allocation and
gives recommendations for buying and selling.
