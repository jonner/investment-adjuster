# investment-adjuster
This is a very simple program that takes as input a file describing an
investment portfolio (currently only Fidelity CSV format is supported). It
compares the holdings in the portfolio to a target allocation configuration
defined in a yaml file. It calculates the changes necessary amounts to buy and
sell in order to bring the portfolio into alignment with the target allocation.
